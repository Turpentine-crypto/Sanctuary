                <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                <p>Who We Are: We believe mental health care should be a right, not a privilege. Whether someone is facing trauma, stress, or isolation, we strive to make sure no one has to struggle alone. With the support of social workers, and hospitals, we ensure that those in urgent need receive the right help, at the right time.</p>
                <p>Our Purpose: Our mission is to provide accessible, stigma-free support through a safe space where individuals can find comfort, guidance, and care—no matter their situation or location.</p>
                <p>How We Work: Our platform offers three levels of mental health care—normal appointments, urgent appointments, and emergency consultations—available across different time zones. We aim to bridge the gap between users and professionals, including those offering pro bono services, ensuring timely support for refugees, veterans, and vulnerable communities.</p>
                <p>Our Values: We operate with compassion, empathy, and respect. These principles guide every interaction on our platform, empowering individuals to seek help without fear of judgment. Together, we build a more connected, understanding, and supportive community.</p>
